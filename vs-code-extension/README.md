# config-lsp for VS Code

`config-lsp` provides language support for various config files.
Currently it supports completions, diagnostics, hints, formatting, hover information,
and definition requests.

Install this extension and load your config files in VS Code to get started.

_config-lsp_ adds the new languages directly to VS Code, so you can use the built-in language selector
at the bottom right of the window to switch between different config files.

**Please note that this extension is still in beta. There are still bugs and missing features.**
I'm working on this as a hobby project in my free time, so I can't provide you with a timeline 
as to when a stable version will be released.
